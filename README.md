# faculties-fluxes-generator
This is an initial prototype to generate the faculties alluvial for the School of Design.
For now the generator only draws the alluvial fluxes. You'll then have to align the graduation boxes and download the svg to finish everything in Illustrator.
Next steps would be: 
1. make the gradution boxes automatically align to the fluxes;
2. generate all the annotations needed.
